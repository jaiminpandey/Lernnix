<h1>AI Assignment Converter - Text to Handwriting</h1>

<p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p>The AI Assignment Converter is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the process of converting AI-generated responses (from ChatGPT or Claude) into realistic handwritten-style assignments. This tool is perfect for students who need to produce handwritten submissions quickly and efficiently. By integrating directly with ChatGPT and Claude, the extension enables users to capture responses and customize them into notebook-style pages, ready for download as PDFs. The project is developed by a small team of college students for personal use and is intended to remain private.</p>
